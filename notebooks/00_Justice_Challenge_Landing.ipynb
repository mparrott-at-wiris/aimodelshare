        "# Ethics at Play\n\n",
        "Welcome to Ethics at Play! You will experience how artificial intelligence can affect real-world decisions. Through immersive, gamified scenarios, you’ll take on roles, make choices, and see the consequences of AI in action—no technical background required.\n\n",
        "Your actions will be guided by the Moral Compass, developed with experts at the Catalonia Observatory of Ethics in Artificial Intelligence (OEIAC) at UDG to measure how ethical your AI solutions are.\n\n",
        "You’ll tackle three challenges:\n\n",
        "1. **Justice & Equity** – Identify bias and learn how to correct it in AI models.\n",
        "2. **Transparency & Explainability** – Make AI decisions understandable and accountable.\n",
        "3. **Sustainability** – Balance environmental impact, privacy, and human oversight to create responsible AI.\n\n",
        "Program coordinated by **Edutech Cluster**, with the support of the **Generalitat de Catalunya**.\n\n",
        "## Justice & Equity Challenge\n\n",
        "This is the flagship module of the Ethics at Play program. Our goal is to raise awareness about the ethical risks of Artificial Intelligence—not through abstract theory, but through a learning-by-doing experience.\n\n",
        "In this challenge, you will:\n\n",
        "- Take on real-world roles, like a judge using AI recommendations and an AI engineer building a new model.\n",
        "- Interact with a gamified scenario based on a real-world AI used to predict criminal risk.\n",
        "- Discover how focusing only on technical accuracy can create unfair, biased outcomes.\n",
        "- Learn to identify, measure, and fix AI bias using an expert ethical framework.\n\n",
        "The full experience takes approximately **1 to 1.5 hours** to complete. At the end, you will earn a **digital education certificate** to recognize your new skills.\n\n",
