                        Right now, your model is judged mostly on <strong>accuracy</strong>. That sounds fair,
                        but accuracy alone can hide important risks—especially when a model is used to make decisions
                        about real people.

                    <p>
                        To make that risk visible, this challenge uses a new metric: your

                                That unlocks more of your model’s base accuracy in the Moral Compass Score.

                    Principles define the <strong>evidence you must collect</strong> and the <strong>tests you must run</strong>. They are crucial because they <strong>create clear, shared standards for evaluation and make findings easy to explain</strong> to everyone. In this case, your evidence and tests will clearly show what counts as bias when you look at the model's data and final results.

                        If one group appears far less or far more than reality (e.g., only <strong>10%</strong> of cases are from Group A, but the group is <strong>71%</strong> of the population), the AI may not have enough data to learn how to make accurate unbiased predictions.

                        Checks for AI prediction mistakes by subgroup (e.g., comparing the false positive rate for Group A vs. Group B). Higher error for a group can mean unfair treatment, which shows the model is less trustworthy or accurate for that specific group.

                        You might ask: <strong>“Why is an AI bias investigation such a big deal?”</strong>

                    <p style="font-size:1.05rem; max-width:800px; margin:0 auto 14px auto;">
                        When a human judge is biased, you can sometimes see it in their words or actions.
                        But with AI, the bias is hidden behind clean numbers. The model produces a neat-looking
                        <strong>“risk of reoffending” score</strong>, and people often assume it is neutral and objective —
                        even when the data beneath it is biased.

                            Once a biased criminal risk model is deployed, it doesn’t just make one bad call.
                            It can quietly repeat the same unfair pattern across <strong>thousands of cases</strong>,
                            shaping bail, sentencing, and future freedom for real people.

                            Because AI bias is silent and scaled, most people never see it happening.
                            That’s where <strong>you</strong>, as a <strong>Bias Detective</strong>, come in.
                            Your role is to look past the polished risk score, trace how the model is using biased data,
                            and show where it might be treating groups unfairly.

                            Next, you’ll start scanning the <strong>evidence</strong> inside the data:
                            who shows up in the dataset, how often, and what that means for the risk scores people receive.
                            You’re not just learning about bias — you’re learning how to <strong>catch it</strong>.

                    We’re examining the <strong>COMPAS dataset</strong>, collected and analyzed by investigative journalists at <strong>ProPublica</strong>. It contains real records used to
                    score a person’s “risk of reoffending,” including demographics (race, age, gender), charges, prior history, and risk scores.

                    If the <em>data itself</em> is skewed (who shows up, how often, or what gets recorded), the model can learn those

                    Your first task is to look at racial patterns in the COMPAS dataset. Each data point is a clue —
                    find distortions and see what they tell us about fairness. Later, you’ll do the same for Gender and
                    Age to check for bias across all groups.
                    <br><br>
                    We focus on these three variables because they are commonly protected groups, and unfair treatment of
                    any of them can lead to serious bias and unfair outcomes in AI decisions.
